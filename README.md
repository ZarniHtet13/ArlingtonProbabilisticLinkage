### Datasets deduplication and Linkage

*This repository is **not** for reproducibility. It is to highlight a portion of the work I have done via some code snippets. The datasets are under strict confidentiality agreement.*

#### Problem Statement

The Department of Human Services in Arlington stores client data of different services in different format and databases. With being unable to link all these different client datasets, the department is unable to answer fundamental questions like how many **unique** clients are they serving in a single day? What are the demographics of those clients?
