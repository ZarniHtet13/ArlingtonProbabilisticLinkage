# ArlingtonProbabilisticLinkage
### Datasets deduplication and Linkage

*This repository is **not** for reproducibility. It is to highlight a portion of the work I have done via some code snippets. The datasets are under strict confidentiality agreement.*

#### Problem Statement

The Department of Human Services in Arlington stores client data of different services in different format and databases. With being unable to link all these different client datasets, the department is unable to answer fundamental questions like how many **unique** clients are they serving in a single day? What are the demographics of those clients?

#### Objective

Our objective is to demonstrate to the stakeholders that by using probablistic linkage we would be able to

1. Remove duplicate client information within each data system (a single data system corresponds to certain line of services).
2. Link different data system which has not shared any primary and foreign key. 

For objective 1, the internal departmental solution is using exact matching. For objective 2, we are coming up with a solution for the department.
